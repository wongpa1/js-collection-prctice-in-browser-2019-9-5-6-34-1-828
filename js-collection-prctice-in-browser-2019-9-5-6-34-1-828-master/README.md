## Practice Output:
You can find requirement detail in the test code comments under `spec\section-n` directory. And you should put your code in the directory `main`.

For example, the production code of `spec/section-1/practice-1-spec.js` should be put  into `main/section-1/practice-1.js`.

And then you should run corrresponding `practice-[number]-run.html` to validate whether your implementations are right or not.
